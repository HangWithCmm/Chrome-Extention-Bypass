Patched in Chrome v106 to check your chrome version goto chrome://version/

To use goto https://chrome.google.com/webstorex you will get a 404 Error but that doesn't matter replace the URL with "javascript:(function () {var a = document.createElement('script');a.src = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HangWithCmm/School-Extention-Disabler/main/bypass.js';document.body.appendChild(a);}())" sometimes you have to add "javascript:" back but after that you will be able to Enable/Disable any extension
